tlsdate: secure parasitic rdate replacement

 tlsdate sets the local clock by securely connecting with TLS to remote
 servers and extracting the remote time out of the secure handshake. Unlike
 ntpdate, tlsdate uses TCP, for instance connecting to a remote HTTPS or TLS
 enabled service, and provides some protection against adversaries that try to
 feed you malicious time information.

On Debian GNU/Linux and related systems, we provide an init.d script that
controls the tlsdated daemon. It will notice network changes and regularly
invoke tlsdate to keep the clock in sync. Start it like so:

  /etc/init.d/tlsdate start

Here is an example an unprivileged user fetching the remote time:

  % tlsdate -V -n -H encrypted.google.com
  Fri Apr 19 17:56:46 PDT 2013


This is an example run - starting as root and dropping to nobody, setting the
clock and printing it:

  % sudo tlsdate -V
  Fri Apr 19 17:57:49 PDT 2013


Here is an example with a custom host and custom port without verification:

  % sudo tlsdate -v --skip-verification -p 80 -H rgnx.net
  V: tlsdate version 0.0.6
  V: We were called with the following arguments:
  V: disable SSL certificate check host = rgnx.net:80
  WARNING: Skipping certificate verification!
  V: time is currently 1366419507.456647065
  V: time is greater than RECENT_COMPILE_DATE
  V: using TLSv1_client_method()
  V: Using OpenSSL for SSL
  V: opening socket to rgnx.net:80
  V: Certificate verification skipped!
  V: public key is ready for inspection
  V: key type: EVP_PKEY_RSA
  V: keybits: 1024
  V: key length appears safe
  V: server time 1366419508 (difference is about -1 s) was fetched in 338 ms
  V: setting time succeeded

Here is an example where a system may not have any kind of RTC at boot. Do the
time warp to restore sanity and do so with a leap of faith:

  % sudo tlsdate -V -l -t
  Fri Apr 19 18:08:03 PDT 2013


Some SSL/TLS services do not provide accurate time in their handshake process;
tlsdate may also be used to fetch time by processing the HTTP Date headers of
HTTP services:

  % sudo tlsdate -V -l -t -w
