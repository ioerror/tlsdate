.SH NAME
tlsdate \- secure parasitic rdate replacement
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tlsdate [-hvs] [-H [hostname]] [-p [port]] [-P [sslv23|sslv3|tlsv1]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B tlsdate
is a tool for setting the system clock by hand or by communication
with the network. It does not set the Real Time Clock. It is designed to be as
secure as TLS (RFC 2246) but of course the security of TLS is often reduced to
whichever CA racket you believe is trustworthy. By default, tlsdate trusts your
local CA root store - so any of these companies could assist in a MITM attack
against you and you'd be screwed.

This tool is designed to be run by hand or as a system daemon. It must be
run as root or otherwise have the proper caps; it will not be able to set
the system time without running as root or another privileged user.
