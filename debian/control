Description: secure parasitic rdate replacement
 tlsdate sets the local clock by securely connecting with TLS to remote
 servers and extracting the remote time out of the secure handshake. Unlike
 ntpdate, tlsdate uses TCP, for instance connecting to a remote HTTPS or TLS
 enabled service, and provides some protection against adversaries that try to
 feed you malicious time information.
