/**
 * \file tlsdate.c
 * \brief The main program to assist in setting the system clock.
 **/

/*
 * tlsdate is a tool for setting the system clock by hand or by communication
 * with the network. It does not set the RTC. It is designed to be as secure as
 * TLS (RFC 2246) but of course the security of TLS is often reduced to
 * whichever CA racket you believe is trustworthy. By default, tlsdate trusts
 * your local CA root store - so any of these companies could assist in a MITM
 * attack against you and you'd be screwed.

 * This tool is designed to be run by hand or as a system daemon. It must be
 * run as root or otherwise have the proper caps; it will not be able to set
 * the system time without running as root or another privileged user.
