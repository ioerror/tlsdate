.SH NAME
tlsdated.conf \- tlsdated config file
.SH SYNTAX
\fBtlsdated.conf\fR is the configuration file for the \fBtlsdated(1)\fR daemon.
The config file is formatted as a list of key-value pairs, one per line,
separated by whitespace. Whitespace inside values is preserved, so
.RS
foo   bar baz quxx
.RE
represents the key \fBfoo\fR mapping to the value \fBbar baz quxx\fR. Empty
lines and lines beginning with \fB#\fR are ignored; leading whitespace on lines
is stripped. For boolean options, the value \fByes\fR or no value at all
indicates that the option should be switched on, and all other values indicate
that the option should be switched off. \fINote that trailing whitespace is
preserved in values.\fR
.SH OPTIONS
.IP argv (string)
Add an argument to the subprocess's argument vector. Use this option multiple
times for multiple arguments.
.IP base-path (string)
Sets the path to tlsdated's cache directory.
.IP dry-run (bool)
If enabled, don't actually adjust the system time.
.IP jitter (int)
Add or subtract up to this many seconds from the steady-state interval when
checking. This helps prevent correlation between sequential checks and smooth
load on time hosts.
.IP max-tries (int)
How many times to try running the tlsdate subprocess.
.IP min-steady-state-interval (int)
Do not check more than once this many seconds when in steady state.
.IP should-load-disk (bool)
If enabled, try loading the current timestamp out of the cache directory.
.IP should-netlink (bool)
If enabled, use a netlink socket to get network events; otherwise, read network
events from stdin.
.IP should-save-disk (bool)
If enabled, save the current timestamp to the cache directory every so often and
at exit.
.IP should-sync-hwclock (bool)
If enabled, set the hwclock to the fetched time.
.IP steady-state-interval (int)
Check at least once this many seconds when in steady state.
.IP subprocess-tries (int)
How many times to try waiting for the subprocess.
.IP subprocess-wait-between-tries (int)
How many seconds to wait between each attempt to wait for the subprocess.
.IP verbose (bool)
If enabled, tlsdated will be annoyingly verbose in syslog and on stdout.
.IP wait-between-tries (int)
How long to wait between runs of the subprocess.
